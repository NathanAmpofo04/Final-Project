A challenge I had to overcome was the hardware issue I was facing.
I learned a lot about hardware and how simple machines actually work 
Robotics in general has interested me so I wanted to explore it with this project 
Trying to overcome some adveristy while coding youtube was my best friend and watching videos really helped me 
Another thing I learned was knowing my limits and knowing what was out of my control
